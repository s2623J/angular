    Notes:
    ------

    Technologies Used:
        1.  MongoDB
        2.  NodeJS (for the API)
        3.  Angular
        4.  Postman
        5.  Robo 3T (GUI for Data Viewing)
        6.  Git
        7.  NPM
        8.  NVM (node version manager)

    Installation:
        Install NVM from:
            https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
            Note:   Must use shell in "administrator" mode
        
    CLI:
      Create a new serice with the CLI (ie. "ng g s services/ng-features")
      Switches may be used to pre-configure a project at creation:
        (ie. "ng new lets-get-lunch --routing --style=css")

    Services:
      Injectables that are usually "providedIn" the root
      Usually injected into other modules via the constructor

    Directives:
      2 types:
        Angular -     Begin with "@" and appear in markup (part of framework)
        Structural -  Affect the DOM's structure
                      Appear in markup preceded with "*" symbol
        Attribute -   Affect element's behavior and appearance

    Pipes:
      Data formatters that also appear in the markup following a pipe symbol

    ngOnInit:
      This is a LIFECYCLE HOOK
      Called once
      Called AFTER the component is constructed
      Invoked with: "implements OnInit" in the class declaration

    Bootstrap:
      Install with: "npm i bootstrap@3.3.7 --save"
      Install requisite jQuery too: "npm i jquery --save"
      Add references to both items in the "angular.json" file

    Best Practices:
      1.  Constructors should only be used for dependancy injection
      2.
